 This project implements an Advanced AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. It utilizes libraries such as NLTK for text lemmatization, scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, and datetime for chat logging. The chatbot is designed to intelligently respond to user queries by matching input text with a predefined knowledge base using semantic similarity rather than exact keyword matching. It includes features such as greeting detection, text preprocessing, confidence-based response filtering to avoid incorrect answers, and persistent chat logging for future analysis. This system demonstrates real-world NLP applications such as question-answering systems, virtual assistants, customer support bots, and educational chatbots. The project highlights advantages like improved accuracy through lemmatization, efficient information retrieval using TF-IDF, modular design for easy scalability, and practical exposure to core AI and NLP concepts, making it an excellent portfolio project for AI, ML, and data science roles.
